The systematic translation of pharmacogenomics data into knowledge of therapeutic possibilities remain challenging. 
In this study, we adopted a similarity-regularized matrix factorization (SRMF) method to predict drug responses. 
Specifically, chemical structural similarity of drugs and gene expression profile similarity of cell lines were incorporated to 
the drug response matrix factorization model to improve the prediction accuracy. The file list is shown as following:
1. resp.mat -- log-transformed IC50 values from GDSC.
2. Drugsim_fig_mt.mat -- chemical structural similarity of drugs.
3. Cellsim_probe.mat -- gene expression profile similarity of cell lines.
4. predict.m -- the main function to predict the drug response values.
